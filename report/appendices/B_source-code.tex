The software has been released under the MIT license, a permissive license that allows remixing and commercial use subject to some simple requirements. The complete text is copied at the end of this appendix.

The code is written with reproducibility in mind and it should be easy to install a Python development environment and run the code. These are the required steps to do so using Continuum Analytics Anaconda distribution:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Install Anaconda Python 3.6 from \url{https://www.continuum.io/downloads}.

\item Download latest development version of the project from \url{https://github.com/Juanlu001/pfc-uc3m/archive/master.zip}

\item Create a virtual environment:

\begin{verbatim}
$ cd pfc-uc3m
$ conda env create  # Will read environment.yml
$ source activate pfc36
(pfc36) $
\end{verbatim}

\item Run tests

\begin{verbatim}
(pfc36) $ cd pfc-uc3m
(pfc36) $ pytest -vvv
\end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}
