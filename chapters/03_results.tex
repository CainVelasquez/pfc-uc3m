\section{Planar maneuvers} \label{sec:resplanar}

For the planar maneuvers, we will skip the semimajor-axis only case as explained in the previous chapter since we were not able to find a validation example, and only briefly comment the numerical results of the other two maneuvers. More details will be given for the more complicated combined maneuvers.

\subsection{Eccentricity change} \label{sec:resecc}

For the two cases in consideration (the one described in the previous chapter and the one corresponding to a reverse change in eccentricity) we were able to recover the expected results from \cite{pollard1997simplified} with a relative error of $10^{-4}$. This can be regarded as a nice result, given that the actual values were not present in the original paper and had to be computed or interpreted from the plots.

The same relative and absolute errors of $10^{-4}$ are obtained for the expected eccentricity after integrating the equations of motion, either with a positive or a negative change in eccentricity. This validates our intuition of reversing the direction of the thrust depending on the sign of $\Delta e$.

\subsection{Argument of periapsis adjustment}

For the only validation example studied in this case, we were able to match the results in \cite{ruggiero2011low} within a relative tolerance of $10^{-2}$. We observe a moderate accuracy in this case due to the fact that the time of flight given by the original paper is approximate and because of the intermediate computations needed to obtain the orbital parameters of the GTO orbit from the information given in the Soyuz User Manual. On the other hand, we did not find any validation example that did take into account the natural apsidal rotation of the orbit, so we openly question the applicability of this example. In any case, the function as it is implemented now, albeit not validated, accepts a precomputed value of $\dot{\omega}$.

Regarding the integration of the trajectory we obtained better results and managed to approximate the final argument of periapsis with a relative error of $10^{-4}$.

\section{Non planar maneuvers} \label{sec:resnonplanar}

\subsection{Combined semimajor axis and inclination change} \label{sec:resedelbaum}

For all the evaluated cases we were able to recover the original results of \cite{kechichian1997reformulation}, with a varying degree of accuracy. For both the expected time of flight $t_f$ and cost $\Delta V$, a relative error of $10^{-5}$ was achieved for the first case, $10^{-3}$ for the second and $10^{-2}$ for the singular case. With the figures given in the original paper, we are unable to assess if the loss of accuracy is due to problems in our algorithm or simply the fact that not all decimal places are included in the text. For the sake of completeness, our results to machine precision are summarized in table~\ref{tab:aincanares}.

Regarding the numerical validation, after integrating the equations of motion for a time $t = t_f$ for the two non singular cases we recover the expected values for final semimajor axis $a$ and inclination $i$ with a relative error of $10^{-5}$ for the former and an absolute error of $10^{-3}$ for the latter. Notice that the relative error makes no sense if we are comparing to zero. The eccentricity does not experiment significant growth and stays equal to zero with an absolute tolerance of $10^{-2}$.

For completeness, we also include the plots of the time history for the semimajor axis, inclination and velocity for the two non singular cases (figures \ref{fig:aincnumres28} and \ref{fig:aincnumres90}), recording the evolution during the integration of the equations of motion. We notice how the semimajor axis significantly increases for the second case, and how most of the inclination change takes place at that moment.

To observe the differences between the numerical and the analytical solution, in figure~\ref{fig:aincdiffinc90} we have plotted the difference between the analytical evolution of the inclination and the numerical solution. While this difference is small compared to the absolute value of the inclination, we notice and oscillatory behavior that is due to the differences within each revolution. In fact, we notice that the frequency of the oscillations decreases as the orbit gets larger, and then rises again.

\subsection{Combined eccentricity and inclination change}

For each of the data points extracted from the plots in \cite{pollard2000simplified}, we were able to recover the expected values of yaw angle $\beta$ and cost $\Delta V$ with a relative error of $10^{-2}$. This case is even more challenging since the precision of the extracted data is limited by the resolution of the plots, even with the help of an automated software. Again, for improving the accuracy more numerical test cases would be needed.

The results of the integration of the third case ($e_0 = 0.4, i_f = 20.0~\text{deg}$) display similar accuracy: the expected final eccentricity and inclination are recovered with a relative error of $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-1}$ respectively. These tolerances are the worst for all the guidance laws in study, although still acceptable. The reverse change in eccentricity has been studied as well to test the algorithm against an initial circular orbit, yielding the same results.

We reproduce here the charts that can be found in \cite{pollard2000simplified} using our own formulas, where it can be seen that the general trend of the plots is respected (figure~\ref{fig:eccincnumcharts}).

\label{fig:eccincnumcharts}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, we also represent the evolution of the eccentricity during the integration of the equations of motion versus the theoretical trend, given by:

\[
e = \sin{\left( \pm \frac{3}{2} f \cos{|\beta|} \sqrt{\frac{a}{\mu}} t + \arcsin{e_0} \right)}
\]

\end{figure}

The discrepancy in the final part of the transfer corresponds with the numerical tolerance achieved for the integration.
